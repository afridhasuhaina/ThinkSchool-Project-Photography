    <p>I’m David duChemin and I want to help you make the strongest, most compelling photographs of your life, and to do so with joy and freedom, to make photographs that are more than just good, but truly your own.</p>
    <p>I’m a world & humanitarian assignment photographer, best-selling author, digital publisher, podcaster, and international workshop leader. Now based on Vancouver Island, Canada, when I’m home, my life is spent chasing compelling images on all 7 continents and teaching others to see, photograph, and get the most from, this astonishing life.</p>
    <p>“Life,” to quote the late Helen Keller, “is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.”</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How can i help you</h2>
    <p>If you want to experience this astonishing world through my eyes, join me as I swim with humpback whales in Tonga, follow the elusive Spirit Bear in Canada’s Great Bear Rain Forest, or experience the Christmas pilgrimage in Lalibela, Ethiopia through my photographs, you can see them in my current portfolios.</p>
    <p>You can share my page to your friends and family, if you like them and would like to share that happiness.</p>
    <p>And if you find your creative life a bit of a daily fight, this is your invitation to listen to A Beautiful Anarchy, my podcast about the joys and challenges of everyday creativity. Short, relevant episodes (usually around 15 minutes long) made for people, like me, who aren’t really podcast people but need the occasional kick in the creative pants, and to know they aren’t alone in what often feels like a fight. You can listen on iTunes, most podcast services, or at aBeautifulAnarchy.com</p>
